# 📊 SageMaker Data Ingestion using Kaggle

## 📚 Background
This project contains a SageMaker Studio Notebook that demonstrates how Kaggle can be used to import data into SageMaker. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is an online community platform that has numerous datasets and ML challenges for data scientists and machine learning enthusiastss 

## 🛠 Set up 
* Clone this repo 
* Upload the Notebook from this repo into SageMaker Studio. This [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-tasks-files.html) shows how to do so. 


## 🤝 Contributing
This was a simple demonstration of data ingestion, you can build on this solution by extracting insights from the data using pandas or perhaps training an ML model. If you do, please feel free to share your project with me. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilbert-young-jr-3098671a4/) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gjyoungjr).
